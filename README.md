Test cases and scenarios regarding given Task below related API endpoints:

"Given" and "Post"

1.POST https://reqres.in/api/users
Body:
{
"name": "morpheus",
"job": "leader"
}
2. GET https://reqres.in/api/users

1. Your tests should contain positive and negative scenarios for endpoint(s).
2. Also tests should include Data Validations for Response
3. Tests should be Written in Java using BDD.
4. Test should use maven as build tool.
5. Should leverage Junit or TestNg Frameworks.

Done with all requirements.

Written scenarios based on GIven,When,Then structure in Gherkin language.

Used maven project with Cucumber BDD Framework based on POM

Used Selenium Web driver to automate the driver

Used Html and Cucumber reports in Target Folders

Used Step_definitions to keep implementation of cases

Used Hooks class to modify before and after annotations

Used Cukes runner to trigger test cases and to connect required files

which step definitions,features,plugins and others

PS: Tried to handle data in different ways while using GET and POST methods
to show my skills but because of limited source and API documentation, it remain limited.
I i believe i could do much more with more soruce of documentation.

Thanks
